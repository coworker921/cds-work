#### Code Review of Continents.tsx #####

1. Incorrect Type Definition for Functional Component

at line 5 of Continents.tsx, it should be:
    type ContinentsComponent = () => JSX.Element;

2. Wrong Type Definition in GraphQL Query Hook

at line 16, it has a simple typo:
    wrong : interface ContinentsQery 
    fixed : interface ContinentsQuery    

3. Incorrect Query Hook Placement

The GraphQL query (Continents) should be defined outside of the component to prevent unnecessary re-declarations on each render.


4. I suggest this

at line 26, instead of earlier one, I would like to write code like this:
    const isEurope = (c: string) => c === 'Europe';

5. Incorrect class Attribute Usage

at line 30, it should be:
    <h3 className={`font-${bold}`}>Continents:</h3>    

6. Incorrect Usage of className 

at line 32, it should be like this:
    <div className={isEurope(name) ? 'text-red-800' : ''}>{name}</div>


#### Code Review of Continents.test.tsx #####

1. Incorrect Expectation in Test

at line 8, findAllByText returns an array, but toBe('Europe') expects a string. So it should be like this:
    expect(item.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
    expect(item[0]).toHaveTextContent('Europe');

2. Missing Mocking of Apollo Client

at line 6, the test does not provide a mock GraphQL response, causing it to fail if run without a live API
